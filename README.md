## üîé LangChain Chatbot with Search

This project is a conversational AI chatbot built using LangChain, Streamlit, and Groq AI. The chatbot leverages various tools like DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv for retrieving information dynamically and intelligently responding to user queries.

## Features
	‚Ä¢	Multi-source search: Query information from DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv.
	‚Ä¢	Conversational interface: Chatbot UI using Streamlit.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic responses: Handles user inputs with an AI-powered language model (Groq‚Äôs Llama3).
	‚Ä¢	Session management: Maintains conversation history across interactions.
	‚Ä¢	Error handling: Graceful fallback for search errors and issues.

## Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.8 or above
	‚Ä¢	Python libraries:
	‚Ä¢	streamlit
	‚Ä¢	langchain
	‚Ä¢	langchain-community
	‚Ä¢	dotenv

 ## Usage
	1.	Open the app in your browser at the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).
	2.	Type your query in the chatbox. For example:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhat is machine learning?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúTell me about General Intelligence AI.‚Äù
	3.	The chatbot will fetch information and respond intelligently.

 ## Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Add more tools (e.g., GPT-4, Bing Search, OpenAI API).
	‚Ä¢	Implement persistent session storage using databases or files.
	‚Ä¢	Enable customization of model parameters via the Streamlit sidebar.
